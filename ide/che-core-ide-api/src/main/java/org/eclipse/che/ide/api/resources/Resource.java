/**
 * The client side analog of file system files and directories. There are exactly three types of resources:
 * files, folders and projects.
 * <p/>
 * Workspace root is representing by {@link Container}. In which only {@link Project} is allowed to be created.
 * <p/>
 * File resources are similar to files in that they hold data directly. Folder resources are analogous to
 * directories in that they hold other resources but cannot directly hold data. Project resources group files
 * and folders into reusable clusters.
 * <p/>
 * Features of resources:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@code Resource} objects are handles to state maintained by a workspace. That is, resources objects
 * do not actually contain data themselves but rather represent resource state and give it behaviour.</li>
 * <li>Resources are identified by type and their {@code path}, which is similar to a file system path.
 * The name of the resource is the last segment of its path. A resource's parent is located by removing
 * the last segment (the resource's name) from the resource's full path.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p/>
 * To obtain already initialized resource in workspace you just need to inject {@link AppContext} into your
 * component and call {@link AppContext#getProjects()} or {@link AppContext#getWorkspaceRoot()}.
 * <p/>
 * Note. This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.
